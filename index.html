            <h2>Shader Live Coding</h2>
            <p>Because I'm often maximalist when it comes to overlapping concepts (especially regarding digital art), I decided to
            restrict myself to the simple concept of masking a colored background with solid shapes, whose outlines grow and shrink
            according to music intensity. Sticking to that goal was rather fun, and forced me to think harder about how to create
            interesting silhouettes. I had a lot of fun playing around with how different angles interact with each other.</p>
            <p>It really shocked me how simple manipulating a grid of squares was—the Book of Shaders stressing using the step()
            function made things a ton easier. From there, adapting the Hexler sine wave example using changes in rotation and
            frequency as well as using 3D Perlin noise to create a pretty, morphing background fit well into the aesthetic I was
            going for.</p>
            <p>As is with all graphics programming, this took me far longer than I expected (and about in line with your time estimate).
            I think I clocked in at about 5 hours. Lots of pacing around the room thinking of ways to layer effects.</p>
            <p>(Gallery coming soon. I need to go to bed.)</p>

            <h2>Video Processing</h2>
            <p>When finding inspiration for different types of noise to incorporate into video, voronoi noise stuck out to me as 
            one extremely capable of replicating real-life natural effects. I noticed that with some pretty simple modifications, 
            it resembles human skin cells (hence its inclusion into the category of 'cell noise'). Actually getting the voronoi
            texture to morph in a way that felt natural took a long time, since I tried my best not to rely on the code snippets
            provided in our reading. The exception to this was the 'random' function, which I was unable to figure out to do in a 
            different way.
            </p>
            <p>By analyzing the brightness value of each pixel, I created a threshold to switch from the regular camera output to
            the cell output. From there, all that was to color the voronoi color palette to resemble skin, and add some ways for 
            users to interact with the effect and mess around with the parameters. Creating silly instructions with pseudoscientific
            results was the cherry on top!</p>
            <p>I set my scope pretty early on, so I was able to finish this in around the same time it took me to do the live coding
            assignment. Clocked in at 5.5 hours.</p>

            <h2>Reaction Diffusion</h2>
            <p>This one was a toughie. Hit probably four major roadblocks where I was slamming my head against the wall for an hour
            or so. One involved the workgroup size, one was surrounding the pingpong feature, one was some mysterious behavior
            involving array indices not displaying correctly, and the final one was difficulties importing uniforms. The end result
            did end up looking lovely—I kept it simple by populating the field with B chemicals wherever the user clicked, and allowing
            them to change the basic parameters of the reaction. I used my tried-and-true method of slapping a cute color gradient
            over a white background. I think I'm accidentally building my visual brand image!</p>
            <p>This one took a while! Over the course of 3 or 4 days, I probably put in about 6 or 7 hours.</p>

            <h2>Particles</h2>
            <p>I drew inspiration from screensavers for this one. I love watching little dots or shapes moving around in organic ways
            while I've been toiling away at a math problem for an hour. The simple behavior of fish seemed fitting to implement using
            a compute shader-I represented each fish using a position, velocity, and rotation, converting from polar to cartesian
            in order to render them. The angle of the fish in relation to others as well as their distance were used to decide whether
            the fish should turn towards or away. The values are fairly sensitive, but it creates some cool swarming patterns! There
            are a few parameters that I decided to not make controls for; attract/avoid radii and weight can break the simulation
            shockingly easily. But, implementing fish size, particle count, and speed controls was easy enough!</p>
            <p>Pretty sure this one was the quickest out of the assignments so far. Probably 4 or 5 hours?</p>

            <h2>Vants</h2>
            <p>For the custom behavior, I implemented an exploding vant that proceeds straight until it hits a pheromone, gets scared,
            and blasts away all of the pheromones within a specific radius before turning left. It was pretty tricky, since I had to
            change how the coordinate system worked pretty significantly for the effect to work properly and to iron out some bizarre
            behavior that would arise if an explosive vant walked off the screen and wrapped around.</p>
            <p>This one took about 3 hours!</p>
