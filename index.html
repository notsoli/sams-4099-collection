            <h2>Shader Live Coding</h2>
            <p>Because I'm often maximalist when it comes to overlapping concepts (especially regarding digital art), I decided to
            restrict myself to the simple concept of masking a colored background with solid shapes, whose outlines grow and shrink
            according to music intensity. Sticking to that goal was rather fun, and forced me to think harder about how to create
            interesting silhouettes. I had a lot of fun playing around with how different angles interact with each other.</p>
            <p>It really shocked me how simple manipulating a grid of squares was—the Book of Shaders stressing using the step()
            function made things a ton easier. From there, adapting the Hexler sine wave example using changes in rotation and
            frequency as well as using 3D Perlin noise to create a pretty, morphing background fit well into the aesthetic I was
            going for.</p>
            <p>As is with all graphics programming, this took me far longer than I expected (and about in line with your time estimate).
            I think I clocked in at about 5 hours. Lots of pacing around the room thinking of ways to layer effects.</p>
            <p>(Gallery coming soon. I need to go to bed.)</p>
